# 🛠 Before You Begin (Required Setup)

You must complete the following steps before running the overlay or scraper.

---

# 1. Install PowerShell Selenium Module

Open PowerShell (right-click → Run as Administrator) and run:

    Install-Module Selenium -Scope CurrentUser

This lets PowerShell control Chrome.

---

# 2. Install Google Chrome + ChromeDriver  
### (SUPER EASY — NO PATH SETUP REQUIRED)

### Step A — Install Google Chrome  
If you already have Chrome installed, skip this.

### Step B — Download ChromeDriver  
1. Go to:  
   https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads  
2. Click the version that matches your Chrome version.  
3. Download the Windows ZIP.  
4. Extract chromedriver.exe  
5. **Place chromedriver.exe in the same folder as skordle.ps1**

Your folder should look like:

    SkordleScoreboardOverlay/
        overlay.html
        gameconfig.json
        skordle.ps1
        chromedriver.exe
        README.md

That’s it. No PATH variables, no extra configuration.

---

# 3. Install and Run ScoreboardOCR

ScoreboardOCR must be running and available at:

    http://localhost:8080/results.json

This is how the overlay gets:
- score  
- fouls  
- clock  
- period  

If you need help setting up ScoreboardOCR, just ask.

# ⚙ Editing Game Settings (gameconfig.json)

All game settings are stored in a simple JSON file.

Example:

    {
      "opponentName": "Texhoma",
      "opponentLogo": "school_logo.png",
      "opponentRecord": "8-2",

      "homeTeamName": "Boise City Wildcats",
      "homeTeamLogo": "bclogo.png",
      "homeRecord": "10-0",

      "gameLevel": "BOYS VARSITY"
    }

### Tips:
- Put logo PNG files in the same folder as overlay.html  
- Keep filenames simple (letters, numbers, underscores)  
- OBS works best with PNG images

# 🏀 Supported Skordle Classes and Example URLs

Skordle URLs follow this pattern:

    https://skordle.com/scores/{SPORT_ID}/{CATEGORY_ID}/{Title}?dateweek=&clubid=1

    B-I Girls:

# 🧪 Using the Skordle Scraper (skordle.ps1)

The PowerShell script loads the correct Skordle page, extracts scores, and saves them into SkordleScores.csv.

### Basic usage:

    ./skordle.ps1

### Choose class and gender:

    ./skordle.ps1 -Class "3A" -Gender "Girls"

### Example for B-I Boys:

    ./skordle.ps1 -Class "B-I" -Gender "Boys"

The ticker inside overlay.html reads SkordleScores.csv and scrolls the live scores.

If you want, I can supply a complete lookup-table-powered version of this script.

# 🌐 How overlay.html Works

It handles:
- Loading configuration  
- Reading ScoreboardOCR  
- Animating score changes  
- Displaying team logos  
- Highlighting the team in the lead  
- Showing the Skordle ticker  

You don’t need HTML knowledge to use it.

# 🎥 Adding the Overlay to OBS (Step-by-Step)

1. Open OBS  
2. In Sources, click **+**  
3. Select **Browser**  
4. Name it “Scoreboard Overlay”  
5. Check **Local File**  
6. Click **Browse**  
7. Select **overlay.html**  
8. Set:

       Width: 1920
       Height: 1080
       FPS: 60

9. Set these options:
   - Shutdown source when not visible → **OFF**  
   - Refresh browser when scene becomes active → **ON**  

If your logos don’t show up, use a full file path:

    file:///C:/OBS/Assets/bclogo.png
